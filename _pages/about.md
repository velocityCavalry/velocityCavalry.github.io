Hi there! My name is Xinyan Yu (余忻妍), you can also call me Velocity :).

I am currently a combined B.S./M.S. student (in the M.S. stage) at University of Washington studying Computer Science. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science (departmental honor) and in Data Science and Statistics under the Applied and Computational Mathematical Science from UW. 
My advisor is [Prof. Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/index.html), [Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/), and [Prof. Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz). My current research interests lie in machine learning and natural language processing, specifically natural language understanding, multilingual NLP, reasoning, probablistic graphical models, and controllable generation. 

 I am super fortunate to work with the very best [Akari Asai](https://akariasai.github.io), [Sewon Min](https://shmsw25.github.io), [Jungo Kasai](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/), [Dr. Rik Koncel-Kedziorski](https://rikdz.github.io) and other amazing graduate students at UW NLP.

I spent some time doing software engineering at some companies. Last fall, I was at the FAM (Facebook Ads) Ranking team at Meta where I implement versioning systems for experiments and multi-armed bandits selection optimization strategies. Last summer, I was an intern at the search features team at Pinterest where I worked on a new user search feature based on the topics users have expressed interests in. Back in 2020, I spent a summer at Microsoft Azure Networking on the OnE (open network emulator) team where I added a pipeline to the network verification system. 

I am happy to answer any questions regarding SWE internship hunting and interviewing!

## Misc
- The reason I am particularly interested in multilinguality is because I am multilingual myself. I can speak Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese, a little bit of German, and a little bit of Spanish. I am learning Cantonese and Shanghainese, too.

- I come from Chongqing, China, a city that is famous for spicy foods, mountains and cyberpunk sceneries. [Kevin Deng](https://www.instagram.com/kevin.deng/?hl=en) is my favorite cameraman who did a really great job picturing Chongqing.
