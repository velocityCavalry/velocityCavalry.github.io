Hi there! My name is Xinyan Yu, (learn how to pronouce it), you can also call me Velocity. 

I am currently a combined B.S./M.S. student at University of Washington studying Computer Science, I am also pursuing a B.S. degree towards Data Science and Statistics under the Applied and Computational Mathematical Science major at UW.  My advisor is [Prof. Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/index.html), and my current research interests lie in machine learning and natural language processing, specifically multilingual QA system, machine translation, and conversational dialogue generation. 

I am super fortunate to work with amazing graduate student and PhDs: [Jungo Kasai](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/) and [Dr. Rik Koncel-Kedziorski](https://rikdz.github.io).

Previously, I spent the summer at Microsoft Azure Networking on the OnE (open network emulator) team where I added a pipeline to the network verification system and had the honor to work with [Chris Johnston](https://chris-johnston.me/about/), [Jitu Padhye](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padhye/), and [Andrey Rybalchenko](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rybal/).

## Misc

I come from Chongqing, China, a city that is famous for spicy foods, mountains and cyberpunk sceneries. [Kevin Deng](https://www.instagram.com/kevin.deng/?hl=en) is my favorite cameraman who did a really great job picturing my hometown.
