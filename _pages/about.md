Hi there! My name is Xinyan Yu (余忻妍), you can also call me Velocity :).

I am currently a combined B.S./M.S. student at University of Washington studying Computer Science, and I am also pursuing a B.S. degree towards Data Science and Statistics under the Applied and Computational Mathematical Science at UW. My advisor is [Prof. Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/index.html) and [Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/), and my current research interests lie in machine learning and natural language processing, specifically multilingual QA system, machine translation, reasoning, probablistic graphical models, and conversational dialogue generation. 

I am super fortunate to work with [Akari Asai](https://akariasai.github.io), [Jungo Kasai](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jkasai/), [Dr. Rik Koncel-Kedziorski](https://rikdz.github.io) and other amazing graduate students at UW NLP.

I spent some time at a lot of companies. Last fall, I was at the FAM (Facebook Ads) Ranking team at Meta where I implement versioning systems for experiments and multi-armed bandits selection optimization strategies. Last summer, I was a intern at the search features team at Pinterest where I worked on a new user search feature based on the topics users have expressed interests in. Back in 2019, I spent a summer at Microsoft Azure Networking on the OnE (open network emulator) team where I added a pipeline to the network verification system.

## Misc
- The reason I am particularly interested in multilinguality is because I am a multilingual myself.I can speak Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese, a little bit of German, and a little bit of Spanish. I am also learning Cantonese and Shanghainese, too.
   
- I come from Chongqing, China, a city that is famous for spicy foods, mountains and cyberpunk sceneries. [Kevin Deng](https://www.instagram.com/kevin.deng/?hl=en) is my favorite cameraman who did a really great job picturing my hometown.
