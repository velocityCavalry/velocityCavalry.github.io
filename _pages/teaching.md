I really enjoy TAing! 

For Data Structures, I mainly created weekly section handouts that is used among roughly 200 people using Lualatex, held office hours to help with **Java** programming projects, and taught quiz sections to solve data structure problems.

For Systems Programming, I built **Python** autograders to automate **C** and **C++** exercises grading processes, held office hours to help with **C** and **C++** programming projects, and taught quiz sections about systems.

For AI, I create **Python** homework projects with the professor, built autograders using **Docker** and **Python** for these homework projects, and held weekly office hours.
